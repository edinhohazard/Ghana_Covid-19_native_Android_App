# Disclaimer 1: 
Please note that information displayed in the app is automatically picked from Ghana health services website https://ghanahealthservice.org/covid19/.. The BOT i am making for this app will make automatic checks and scrape the Ghana health services site for new data every 24hours automatically in the app.. It only uses the figures provided by my homeland's government to display an accurate beautiful graph on mobile app easy to read... 100% native and kotlin and open source...

# Disclaimer 2:
Please note that, My home country Ghana, is a country that plays politics with every situation.. They are massive religious sycophants and socialists too..  So i cannot even vouch for, or be held accountable for the figures produced by the government of Ghana health service itself where my Bot scrapes data from.. (Basically, what i am saying is, I cannot vouch for the Ghanaian Government's intergrity or trustworthiness, I am just an ordinary citizen of the country)... This is because, whilst Scientists and engineers see regularly updated data as very important in drawing curves of cases against time about covid 19, A typical Government official in Ghana may decide to hide figures for sometime and not publish cases DAILY.. This is because they may think the reality of the curves we all see in developed countries may make it seem to the outside world that, the Government in Ghana is not in control of the fight in Ghana. This may hurt the political chances of the NPP political party currently in power, 

hence in such a country, its very normal for government to lie or hide information and release it in bits.. (Thats their focus, my focus is just data so please dont hold me accountable if their figures are lies)..  you would even realize that data on the official source https://ghanahealthservice.org/covid19/ site is not updated daily.. sometimes its done once or twice a week... As a result we may not have a similar-looking cure from this data due to the Ghana government decision to hide or update data whenever they feel like it... Their data is not provided in specific timeframes like what is done by the American, Sweden, turkey and other more developed open governments who put politics aside and update data regularly creating a valid curves that can be analized accurately by all of us..        

As seen in China, the WHO is a powerless organization and cannot prevent any government in the world from lying about number cases at the moment.. They only depend on the "word of mouth" of each Government for their information on number of cases.. This is why China lied in December 2019 about the mode of tranmission of the virus and it was carried as gospel by the W.H.O. although Chinese government lied back then... This was the cause of the whole pandemic, had china been truthful at the beginning, it would have ended quickly in wuhan just like SARS did..           


# Why it was made today 10th aprill..
Bored in quarantine i decided this saturday to create an app to display data of covid cases in my home country Ghana.. since its not part of what i made for our clients from other countries. This app and API for Ghana should be up and running today by 8pm Ghana time or 10PM Swedish time
